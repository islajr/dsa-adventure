# Data Structures in Java

Data structures are a way of organizing data in a computer memory to ensure they are **saved** and **accessed** efficiently.

## Classification

There are two main classifications of data structures, namely:

* Linear Data structures
* Non-linear data structures

### Linear Data Structures

This data structure arranges elements sequentially (after the previous one).
Linear data structures are of two types:
    - **Static**: Has a fixed memory size, hence, it is easy to access the elements. E.g: Arrays.
    - **Dynamic**: Here, the size is not fixed and can be randomly updated during runtime.
    This is considered to be more memory-efficient than the static type.
    Examples include: queue, stack.

### Non-linear Data Structures

This data structure does not arrange elements sequentially. As a result, all the elements in the data structure cannot be accessed in a single run, like the linear data structure.
Examples are: trees and graphs.
